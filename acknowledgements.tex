\section*{Acknowledgements}
We thank Peter Sullivan for his support in the early phases of this 
work and for helpful comments on our results.
We similarly thank Roland Vanderspek for fielding numerous questions
concerning \tess hardware, and more broadly we are grateful to the teams 
at MIT, Orbital, Goddard, Ames, Kennedy and other institutions for 
their work.
We also thank Jack Lissauer for input regarding the value of observing 
\keplers field with \textit{TESS}.
The \tess project provided the computing resources used in this work and Ed 
Morgan, Isaac Meister, and Kenton Philips keep those machines running.
