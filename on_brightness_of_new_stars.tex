While \npole\:does well by most metrics, a larger proportion of its newly 
detected planets orbit dimmer stars than the planet populations detected from 
alternatives like \hemis\:or \shemiAvoid.
We demonstrate this in Fig.~\ref{fig:icmag_meta}.
The main point here is that if our only priority were to maximize the number of new detections around bright host stars, then \npole\:would be the worst among the scenarios considered here.
% then why didn't we include this in fig 13?
For instance, arbitrarily setting the bound at $I_c<10$ and numerically 
integrating from Fig.~\ref{fig:icmag_meta}'s data, we see in 
Table~\ref{tab:icmag_meta} that there is a $\sim30\%$ difference between the 
missions.
For point of reference, the Primary Mission detects 386 such planets -- so a single year of Extended Mission detects roughly as many planets orbiting bright hosts as a single year of Primary Mission.

	\caption{Number of new, $I_c<10$, $R_p<4R_\oplus$ planets from each Extended Mission (average of 50 Monte Carlo realizations of our code; showing sum of PSs \& FFIs). \npole\:detects the fewest new planets orbiting bright stars.}

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\nhemi & \npole & \shemiAvoid & \elong & \eshort & \hemis \\ \hline
		162    & 154    & 190         & 167    & 183     & 198    \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	%I put together this table by running /ext_mission_comparisons/memo_processing with the 160729_t50 data, and then just directly printing the numbers.

\begin{comment}
A related, but minor comment: \tesss is able to detect the smallest planets at the ecliptic poles, rather than near the ecliptic, due to background flux from zodiacal light.
