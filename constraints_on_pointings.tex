\subsection{Constraints on \tesss Observing}
\label{sec:constraints_on_pointings}

When considering possible schedules for telescope pointings, the main
constraint is that the cameras must be directed approximately opposite
the Sun.  Specifically, the center of the combined fields-of-view is
ideally pointed within 15$^\circ$ in ecliptic longitude of the antisolar 
direction, and no more than 30$^\circ$ away.
%\todo[inline]{Roland: are these numbers still good? are they imposed by the sunshade? or solar panels? Some comment appreciated.} 
This enables the solar panels to collect
sufficient sunlight to power the spacecraft.
Fig.~\ref{fig:spacecraft_angles}) illustrates the geometry. The solar
panels are free to rotate about the $Y$-axis.

It is also important for the sunshade and 
spacecraft to block sunlight.
Given the spacecraft's orbit~\citep{gangestad_high_2013},
this means that \tess should advance $\approx$$28^\circ$ east in ecliptic
longitude every lunar month, as it does during the Primary Mission.
This makes it difficult to remain pointed at a given field for more than two spacecraft orbits ($\approx$42
days), would be in tension with this requirement.  In practice,
another technical restriction is whether the Earth or Moon passes
through \tesss camera fields during a proposed pointing (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:earth_moon_crossings}).

In addition, the spacecraft has finite fuel reserves for necessary maneuvers.
These are expected to last at least 10 years [G. Ricker, priv. comm.]. We 
consequently do not consider this as a constraint on the three-year time 
horizon that is the focus of this study.
