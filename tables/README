160708-* doesn't have earth and moon crossings

160729* does.

That's the only difference (unless you see something important and accidental in the git changes)

no-deming was before I ran this with the deming update (which is why all the tables are up-dated for Aug 13).
deming was once I ran it with Drake Deming's formula.
