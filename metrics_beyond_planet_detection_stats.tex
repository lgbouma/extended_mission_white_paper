\section{Broader science beyond exoplanet detection statistics}
\label{sec:broader_science_beyond_planet_detection_stats}

% It will pay to be COMPREHENSIVE here. That means REFERENCES, and a clear indication of where our thoughts are on all of these metrics.

Observing with \tess for more than two years could lead to more than just the new planet detections that we quantified in Sec.~\ref{sec:newly_detected_planet_metrics}.
An extended mission offers the chance to re-examine our top-level priorities. %that go beyond those of the primary mission.
We record and in some cases provide order of magnitude estimates for desires and opportunities that do not fall under the purview of `planet detection statistics' in what follows.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:broader_exoplanet_science}, we discuss metrics related to exoplanet science beyond \tesss primary aim of finding of small planets transiting bright stars.
We then highlight observations that \tess could perform for their implications in broader astrophysics, in particular stellar physics, solar system science, and time-domain astronomy (Sec.~\ref{sec:broader_nonexo_science}).
The main reason to discuss these broader desires is that they may play a role in influencing \tesss long term observing strategy.
This section focuses entirely on observations that \tess can perform by itself.
The next section (Sec.~\ref{sec:risks_opps}) points out opportunities in which \tess data could be combined with other datasets and facilities.
