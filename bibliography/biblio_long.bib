We discuss some statistical features of the sample. Period distributions show distinct differences between SMC and LMC populations of RR Lyr variable stars, with the SMC stars having on average longer periods. The mean periods for RRab, RRc and RRe stars are 0.596, 0.366 and 0.293 days, respectively. The mean apparent magnitudes of RRab stars are equal to 19.70 mag in the V-band and 19.12 mag in the I-band. Spatial distribution of RR Lyr stars shows that the halo of the SMC is roughly round in the sky, however the density map reveals two maxima near the center of the SMC.

	abstract = {The eleventh part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars (OIII-CVS) contains 16836 RR Lyr stars detected in the OGLE fields toward the Galactic bulge. The total sample is composed of 11756 RR Lyr stars pulsating in the fundamental mode (RRab), 4989 overtone pulsators (RRc), and 91 double-mode (RRd) stars. About 400 RR Lyr stars are members of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. The catalog includes the time-series photometry collected in the course of the OGLE survey, basic parameters of the stars, finding charts, and cross-identifications with other catalogs of RR Lyr stars toward the Milky Way center. We notice that some RRd stars in the Galactic bulge show unusually short periods and small ratio of periods, down to P\_F=0.35 days and P\_1O/P\_F=0.726. In the Petersen diagram double-mode RR Lyr stars form a parabola-like structure, which connects shorter- and longer-period RRd stars. We show that the unique properties of the bulge RRd stars may be explained by allowing for the wide range of the metal abundance extending up to [Fe/H]=-0.36. We report the discovery of an RR Lyr star with additional eclipsing variability with the orbital period of 15.2447 days. Some statistical features of the RR Lyr sample are presented. We discuss potential applications of our catalog in studying the structure and history of the central region of the Galaxy, mapping the interstellar extinction toward the bulge, studying globular clusters and the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy.},

Although they are used empirically to measure cosmological distances, the nature of their progenitors remains mysterious. One of the leading progenitor models, called the single degenerate channel, hypothesizes that a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star and the resulting increase in its central pressure and temperature ignites thermonuclear explosion. Here we report observations with the Swift Space Telescope of strong but declining ultraviolet emission from a type Ia supernova within four days of its explosion. This emission is consistent with theoretical expectations of collision between material ejected by the supernova and a companion star, and therefore provides evidence that some type Ia supernovae arise from the single degenerate channel.},

Observations of a supernova immediately following the explosion provide unique information on the distribution of ejected material and the progenitor system. Models predict that the interaction of supernova ejecta with a companion star or circumstellar debris lead to a sudden brightening lasting from hours to days. Here we present data for three supernovae that are likely to be type Ia observed during the Kepler mission with a time resolution of 30 minutes. We find no signatures of the supernova ejecta interacting with nearby companions. The lack of observable interaction signatures is consistent with the idea that these three supernovae resulted from the merger of binary white dwarfs or other compact stars such as helium stars.},

This will bring new opportunities and challenges, in particular the presence of a large number of main-belt asteroids that will contaminate the photometry. The large pixel size makes K2 data susceptible to the effect of apparent minor planet encounters. Here we investigate the effects of asteroid encounters on photometric precision using a sub-sample of the K2 Engineering data taken in February, 2014. We show examples of asteroid contamination to facilitate their recognition and distinguish these events from other error sources. We conclude that main-belt asteroids will have considerable effects on K2 photometry of a large number of photometric targets during the Mission, that will have to be taken into account. These results will be readily applicable for future space photometric missions applying large-format CCDs, such as TESS and PLATO.},

	abstract = {We present the first photometric observations of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) taken with the Kepler space telescope, obtained in the course of the K2 ecliptic survey. Two faint objects have been monitored in specifically designed pixel masks that were centered on the stationary points of the objects, when their daily motion was the slowest. In the design of the experiment, only the apparent path of these objects were retrieved from the detectors, i.e. the costs in terms of Kepler pixels were minimized. Because of the faintness of the targets we employ specific reduction techniques and co-added images. We measure rotational periods and amplitudes in the unfiltered Kepler band as follows: for (278361) 2007 JJ43 and 2002 GV31 we get P\_rot=12.097 h and P\_rot=29.2 h while 0.10 and 0.35 mag for the total amplitudes, respectively. Future space missions, like TESS and PLATO are not well suited to this kind of observations. Therefore, we encourage to include the brightest TNOs around their stationary points in each observing campaign to exploit this unique capability of the K2 Mission -- and therefore to provide unbiased rotational, shape and albedo characteristics of many objects.},

Potential transit signals are subjected to further analysis using the pixel-level data, which allows background eclipsing binaries to be identified through small image position shifts during transit. We also re-evaluate Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) 1-1609, which were identified early in the mission, using substantially more data to test for background false positives and to find additional multiple systems. Combining the new and previous KOI samples, we provide updated parameters for 2738 Kepler planet candidates distributed across 2017 host stars. From the combined Kepler planet candidates, 472 are new from the Q1-Q8 data examined in this study. The new Kepler planet candidates represent 40\% of the sample with R P 1 R ⊕ and represent 40\% of the low equilibrium temperature ( T eq {\textless} 300 K) sample.

We describe a Hungarian Automated Telescope (HAT) system, which attempts to meet these requirements. The attainable precision of HAT has been significantly improved by a technique in which the telescope is made to execute small pointing steps during each exposure so as to broaden the effective point-spread function (PSF) of the system to a value more compatible with the pixel size of our CCD detector. Experiments during a preliminary survey (spring 2003) of two star fields with the HAT-5 instrument allowed us to optimize the HAT photometric precision using this method of PSF broadening; in this way we have been able to achieve a precision as good as 2 mmag on brighter stars. We briefly describe development of a network of longitudinally spaced HAT telescopes (HATNet).},

This can be detected from the ground using modest-aperture telescopes by targeting samples of nearby M dwarfs. Such planets would be very amenable to follow-up studies due to the brightness of the parent stars, and the favourable planet-star flux ratio. MEarth is such a transit survey of 2000 nearby M dwarfs. Since the targets are distributed over the entire (Northern) sky, it is necessary to observe them individually, which will be done by using 8 independent 0.4m robotic telescopes, two of which have been in operation since December 2007 at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) located on Mount Hopkins, Arizona. We discuss the survey design and hardware, and report on the current status of the survey, and preliminary results obtained from the commissioning data.},

Each XO camera consists of a 200 mm f/1.8 lens coupled to a 1024 × 1024 pixel, thinned CCD operated by drift-scanning. In its first year of routine operation, XO has observed 6.6\% of the sky within six 7° wide strips scanned from 0° to +63° of declination and centered at R.A. = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 hr. Autonomously operating, XO records 1 billion pixels per clear night, calibrates them photometrically and astrometrically, performs aperture photometry, archives the pixel data, and transmits the photometric data to the Space Telescope Science Institute for further analysis. From the first year of operation, the resulting database consists of photometry of 100,000 stars at more than 1000 epochs per star, with differential photometric precision better than 1\% per epoch. Analysis of the light curves of those stars produces transiting-planet candidates requiring detailed follow-up, described elsewhere, culminating in spectroscopy to measure radial velocity variation in order to differentiate genuine planets from the more numerous impostors, primarily eclipsing binary and multiple stars.},

Three fields (35'x35' each) located in the Carina regions of the Galactic disk (l{\textasciitilde}290) were monitored continuously in February-May 2002. About 1150 epochs were collected for each field. The search for low depth transits was conducted on about 103000 stars with photometry better than 15 mmag. In total, we discovered 62 objects with shallow depth ({\textless}0.08 mag) flat-bottomed transits. For each of these objects several individual transits were detected and photometric elements were determined. Also lower limits on radii of the primary and companion were calculated. The 2002 OGLE sample of stars with transiting companions contains considerably more objects that may be Jupiter-sized (R{\textless}1.6 R\_Jup) compared to our 2001 sample. There is a group of planetary candidates with the orbital periods close to or shorter than one day. If confirmed as planets, they would be the shortest period extrasolar planetary systems. In general, the transiting objects may be extrasolar planets, brown dwarfs, or M-type dwarfs. One should be, however, aware that in some cases unresolved blends of regular eclipsing stars can mimic transits. Future spectral analysis and eventual determination of the amplitude of radial velocity should allow final classification. High resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations are, therefore, strongly encouraged. All photometric data are available from the OGLE Internet archive. Note added for astro-ph version: One of the best planetary candidates from the OGLE 2001 campaign, OGLE-TR-56, has recently been confirmed as a planetary system by Konacki, Torres, Jha and Sasselov [astro-ph/0301052].},

We compute the achievable accuracy for the parameters of interest, in general and for the five known cases of transiting exoplanets with bright host stars. We determine the requirements for detecting the effects of differential rotation. For transiting planets with small masses or long periods (as will be detected by forthcoming satellite missions), the velocity anomaly produced by the RM effect can be much larger than the orbital velocity of the star. For a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of a Sunlike star found by the Kepler mission, it will be difficult to use the RM effect to confirm transits with current instruments, but it still may be easier than measuring the spectroscopic orbit.},

	abstract = {The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of exoplanets and revolutionized our understanding of their population. This large, homogeneous catalog of discoveries has enabled rigorous studies of the occurrence rate of exoplanets and planetary systems as a function of their physical properties. However, transit surveys like Kepler are most sensitive to planets with orbital periods much shorter than the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn, the most massive planets in our Solar System. To address this deficiency, we perform a fully automated search for long-period exoplanets with only one or two transits in the archival Kepler light curves. When applied to the \${\textbackslash}sim 40,000\$ brightest Sun-like target stars, this search produces 16 long-period exoplanet candidates. Of these candidates, 6 are novel discoveries and 5 are in systems with inner short-period transiting planets. Since our method involves no human intervention, we empirically characterize the detection efficiency of our search. Based on these results, we measure the average occurrence rate of exoplanets smaller than Jupiter with orbital periods in the range 2-25 years to be \$2.0{\textbackslash}pm0.7\$ planets per Sun-like star.},

	abstract = {The census of exoplanets is incomplete for orbital distances larger than 1 AU. Here, we present 41 long-period planet candidates in 38 systems identified by Planet Hunters based on Kepler archival data (Q0-Q17). Among them, 17 exhibit only one transit, 14 have two visible transits and 10 have more than three visible transits. For planet candidates with only one visible transit, we estimate their orbital periods based on transit duration and host star properties. The majority of the planet candidates in this work (75\%) have orbital periods that correspond to distances of 1-3 AU from their host stars. We conduct follow-up imaging and spectroscopic observations to validate and characterize planet host stars. In total, we obtain adaptive optics images for 33 stars to search for possible blending sources. Six stars have stellar companions within 4". We obtain high-resolution spectra for 6 stars to determine their physical properties. Stellar properties for other stars are obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Kepler Stellar Catalog by Huber et al. (2014). We validate 7 planet candidates that have planet confidence over 0.997 (3-\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} level). These validated planets include 3 single-transit planets (KIC-3558849b, KIC-5951458b, and KIC-8540376c), 3 planets with double transits (KIC-8540376b, KIC-9663113b, and KIC-10525077b), and 1 planet with 4 transits (KIC-5437945b). This work provides assessment regarding the existence of planets at wide separations and the associated false positive rate for transiting observation (17\%-33\%). More than half of the long-period planets with at least three transits in this paper exhibit transit timing variations up to 41 hours, which suggest additional components that dynamically interact with the transiting planet candidates. The nature of these components can be determined by follow-up radial velocity and transit observations.},

Our validated systems span a range of properties, with median values of R\_P = 2.3 R\_E, P=8.6 d, Tef = 5300 K, and Kp=12.7 mag. Stellar spectroscopy provides precise stellar and planetary parameters for most of these systems. We show that K2 has increased by 30\% the number of small planets known to orbit moderately bright stars (1-4 R\_E, Kp=9-13 mag). Of particular interest are 37 planets smaller than 2 R\_E, 15 orbiting stars brighter than Kp=11.5, five receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet systems -- including four planets orbiting the M dwarf K2-72 near mean-motion resonances. By quantifying the likelihood that each candidate is a planet we demonstrate that our candidate sample has an overall false positive rate of 15-30\%, with rates substantially lower for small candidates ({\textless} 2 R\_E) and larger for candidates with radii {\textgreater} 8 R\_E and/or with P {\textless} 3 d. Extrapolation of the current planetary yield suggests that K2 will discover between 500-1000 planets in its planned four-year mission -- assuming sufficient follow-up resources are available. Efficient observing and analysis, together with an organized and coherent follow-up strategy, is essential to maximize the efficacy of planet-validation efforts for K2, TESS, and future large-scale surveys.},

K2 will use an innovative way of operating the spacecraft to observe target fields along the ecliptic for the next 2-3 years. Early science commissioning observations have shown an estimated photometric precision near 400 ppm in a single 30 minute observation, and a 6-hr photometric precision of 80 ppm (both at V = 12). The K2 mission offers long-term, simultaneous optical observation of thousands of objects at a precision far better than is achievable from ground-based telescopes. Ecliptic fields will be observed for approximately 75 days enabling a unique exoplanet survey which fills the gaps in duration and sensitivity between the Kepler and TESS missions, and offers pre-launch exoplanet target identification for JWST transit spectroscopy. Astrophysics observations with K2 will include studies of young open clusters, bright stars, galaxies, supernovae, and asteroseismology.},

We present a method for searching K2 light curves for evidence of exoplanets by simultaneously fitting for these systematics and the transit signals of interest. This method is more computationally expensive than standard search algorithms but we demonstrate that it can be efficiently implemented and used to discover transit signals. We apply this method to the full Campaign 1 dataset and report a list of 36 planet candidates transiting 31 stars, along with an analysis of the pipeline performance and detection efficiency based on artificial signal injections and recoveries.

	abstract = {We present here a fast code for creating a synthetic survey of the Milky Way. Given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size and geometry, the code returns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given model of the Milky Way. The model can be specified by a set of density distributions or as an N-body realization. We provide fast and efficient algorithms for sampling both types of models. As compared to earlier sampling schemes which generate stars at specified locations along a line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuous and smooth distribution of stars over any given volume. The code is quite general and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate, age metallicity relation, age velocity dispersion relation and analytic density distribution functions. Theoretical isochrones are then used to generate a catalog of stars and support is available for a wide range of photometric bands. As a concrete example we implement the Besancon Milky Way model for the disc. For the stellar halo we employ the simulated stellar halo N-body models of Bullock \& Johnston (2005). In order to sample N-body models, we present a scheme that disperses the stars spawned by an N-body particle, in such a way that the phase space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that of the N-body particles. The code is ideally suited to generating synthetic data sets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as GAIA, LSST and HERMES. As an application we study the prospect of identifying structures in the stellar halo with a simulated GAIA survey. We plan to make the code publicly available at http://galaxia.sourceforge.net.},

	abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K{\textgreater}30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with
	-0.5{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar
	metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]{\textgreater}+0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil
	signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or
	eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

Our stellar sample ranges from M dwarfs with masses as low as0.2 M ⊙ to intermediate-mass subgiants with masses as high as1.9 M ⊙ .
