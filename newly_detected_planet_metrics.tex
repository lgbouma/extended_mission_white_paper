\section{Planet detection statistics}  
\label{sec:newly_detected_planet_metrics}

Using the planet detection model described in Sec.~\ref{sec:planet_detection_model} and the target selection procedure of Sec.~\ref{sec:selection_criteria}, we simulate three years of \tess observing, with for six cases for third-year extended missions: \nhemi, \npole, \shemiAvoid, \elong, \eshort, and \hemis.
How many new planets do we detect, and how do their properties differ between extended missions?
We give results for planets with radii $R_p < 4R_\oplus$, due to both the subtlety and computational cost of modeling full frame image recovery of giant planets near the galactic disk.
