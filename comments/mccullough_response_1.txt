I see your point. My source for the claim was R Vanderspek, but he may have
been wrong and I (embarassingly) did not do the order of magnitude check.

Doing the calculation, it actually seems worse than your note makes out. 
The spacecraft boresight (+Z in Fig 2) is 90deg from the sun in the
pole scenario, so camera 4's boresight is only 45 deg away from solar (in
latitude). 
So it's more like 10^{-7} suppression, or around 18 magnitudes, which means the 
Sun is roughly V=-8 spread "uniformly" (not actually, but for OOM calcn). 
Winn 2013's tabulation of the photon fluxes indicates an I=0 G2V star produces
1.6x10^6 ph/s/cm^2. Saying V=I, being 8 mags brighter than I=0 means ~1600x as 
much flux, or 2.5x10^9 ph/s/cm^2. 
Since each lens has an effective observing area of 69cm^2, this gives 1.7e11 
ph/s across an entire lens. 

The requirements are quoted in ct/s/px, so divide by 4096^2 px^2, gives 1.0e4
ph/s/px. 100% QE brings 1.0e4 ct/s/px. 

This is ~30x the "treshold" we set when noting "risky fields" for dropping in Sec1.6, 
and means (multiply by 2 to get the mean ct/px per 2 sec image, then take a sqrt
to estimate the variance) an additional ~140 ct/px RMS per 2 sec image.

********* THEN LOOK AT THIS ON THE NOISE VARIANCE PLOT.

The point is that we will not a priori know the true host star magnitude in
binary systems, b/c for most we will not know that they are binaries. So
in target prioritization, binaries will be thought to be brighter than the
actual brightness of the transit-hosting star. 
So they will be contaminating the "high-priority" candidate list.
So I think we're doing this right...

Added a parenthetical to clarify.

See primary_number_PSs_vs_cam_field.pdf. This scheme means ~20-25k target stars per 
field at the pole-pointing camera, which is "high" compared to the ~16k targets
per month that J Jenkins et al at AMES are writing their pipeline for. I talked w/ 
Vanderspek & the TSC about this and they indicated that ~16k is lower-bound and
should not be viewed as a constraint (other people will process the data too).

The real _constraint_ here is how many bytes we can send from the spacecraft to
earth per orbit. I don't have that number (& if I were defining this process
again, would rather start from that). We said 200k target stars total over 2 
years (which is a number from the proposal), then did the weighting scheme this 
way, and it wound up producing ~30k target stars per orbit (~2x what AMES is 
expecting). However, the ~16k is just so their pipeline runs efficiently on 
postage stamps... there's no per-camera hard maximum # of target stars.

Right. It uses R_star and expected photometric performance to go as deep as we
think small-planet detections will work.
If we just wanted greatest number of _planets_, we could look near the galactic
plane and find many giant planets (up to star confusion).
The (not-rigorously-proven) idea is that by using something that looks like a
SNR without any planet radius term (since we don't know the radii a priori), 
we're selecting stars most-suited towards high-SNR planet detections.
Part of the point of the discussion is that this isn't rigorous. An
empirical parameter study where powers of terms were tuned would be useful.

Note that Sullivan et al used a different procedure. They said "imagine
all stars have a R_p = R_earth planet on a P=10day orbit. Count the number of
stars for which TESS could detect that planet. If <200,000, increase the radius
of the fiducial planet, and repeat until there are 200,000 stars for which TESS
would detect the nominal small-planet on the 10day orbit."
This approach produced a very similar distribution of host-star Teff and Rstar
as the procedure I used here, which provides some level of credibility perhaps.

skimming the pre-print, no.

I see your point.
I may move this discussion of alternative prioritization approaches to "risks and caveats".
TBD.

> p17: something's wrong.

I found the wrong thing (I think. See precision_memo.pdf attached). 
I now compute these lines the same as I'm doing the read noise, which is much
more clear in the code (I was previously just scaling from the read noise,
which I think missed stray sqrts). 
Also clarified the figure + tied it to the text, and removed the copy in the
appendix.

This also led to me regenerating Fig 26, which used values from these plots.
I added a note on saturation per your p.18 comment in Fig 26.

It also prompted a rewriting of a few of the paragraphs in Sec1.6, notably
changing the discussion of what 300ct/s/px means given the updated plot.
Specifically, (p22 below) I drop the discussion of how our prediction
"underestimates the effect of Earth Moon crossings", instead pointing out
arguments for each side.
I could include some mention of how we at least have an _upper bound_ on how
bad it is from the time-resolved simulations, but I doubt that would be
particularly illuminating.

Q: I see what you mean -- the thing we care about at the end of the day is the
quadrature sum of all the noise sources. But we can still talk about the RMS of
a given source, no? Perhaps my usage is wrong.
If we have some flux source with a mean flux 位, and assume Poisson statistics,
the standard deviation is roughly sqrt(位). (Since the Poisson distribution is
approximately the same as the Gaussian in the large 位 limit).
I am referring to the standard deviation sqrt(位) as the "RMS".
Is this a word that is reserved for the quadrature sum of all noise sources?

> p22:
I rewrote these paragraphs to drop any mention of whether our approximation is
over or underestimates the effect.
I present both sides of why we might either be over or underestimating the
effect.

=====
todo:
* email Roland: does he know something we don't about why scattered sunlight
  can be neglected for the pole scenario?
* p2 "a lot of these are simply changing Ntra=1 to Ntra=2"
  -> mention the low Ntra statistics result in exec summ?
* p7 pole suppression: is it actually blocking the sun adequately? really not
  obvious (see OOM calcn).
* p16: we're getting into alternatives, is it too early?
  -> move discussion of alternative prioritization approaches to end?
* p19: alternative rendering of outage plots? (clearer as McCollough suggested)
  (can also then do grayscale, & possibly grayscale __summed__ row)
* p21: it would make more sense for us to account for scattered sunlight in the
  same manner as zodiacal light in S+15. Compute a photon flux which varies as
  a function of ecliptic latitude & LONGITUDE. Assuming longitude=0 (in sun
  direction), combine with lens hood plot **analytically**
* Sec 1.1: add discussion of OOM issue with an pole-focused mission:
  looking at the ecliptic pole btwn 2&3 puts 4 just 45deg off from the sun.
  This is bad.


other:

* Kipping & Lam 2016 seemed to have missed this question of the probability of 
  detecting an outer companion as a function of the orbital inclination of the 
  inner companion.
  Likely be worth emailing them about.
