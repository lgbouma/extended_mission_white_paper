I didn't want to b/c "New" candidates and "Pri" (from Primary) candidates are
conceptually different -- didn't want to lump.
It's also a comparison that I want to be drawing "intra" Extended Mission
scenarios, rather than "inter" Extended Missions and Primary Missions.

> p36: a,b,c,d,e.
Read; likely won't mention, but I like the scaling arguments!
I still wish Eq(4) had a Jmag, but D. Deming's confident that the offset is 
corrected for in the prefactors.
