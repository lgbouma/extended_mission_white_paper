Agreed, done.

As am I. I've only been assured by George that it's fine to not consider this
as a relevant constraint.

IMO the Exec Summ stands almost alone from the rest of the document. The 
decision is either a) force people to refer back many pages to a smaller version 
with a less descriptive caption, or b) have it twice. I took (b).

Agreed; done.

Done.

>> Page 10 - CoRoT, JWST, CHEOPS, K2 are all undefined, though likely well known

Yeah, I'm going to assume that anyone reading this knows (and this section,
which is basically just a list, needs to be brief).

>> Page 12 - I don't know what you mean by "red noise", and Molly (an actually

This is colloquial usage that I'll cut. Meant it as "noise that's not white &
thus doesn't decrease upon binning as T^{-1/2}". Technically means noise with a 
power spectral density that goes ~1/f^2, so will cut.

>> Page 16 - Neural Networks for target selection sounds so cool!

Totally! That said it's a bit buzz-wordy. You could do the optimization with
less fashionable minimization schemes & likely get similar results.

Trying new colors that I think help clarify. Patched up x label to clarify.
I agree it's a dense plot, but I think it gets the point across (and the
caption helps if not).

Right. I won't make any changes on this (I think the idea is reasonably clear);
let me know if you'd like me to.

Yes. Turned out resolving it into the same 1/20th of an orbit timesteps (an option 
that I played with) was too expensive. My main defense of the rounding is that
there's a LOT of nitty-gritty in how much this effect will actually matter. Are
the lens hoods at or better than spec? What is TESS's orbital phasing? Initial
simulations from the lens-hood people show that the scattered light actually
only affects specific sections of the CCDs more than othes (it's not a uniform
effect). This might help or hinder during near-crossings at the factor of ~a
few.

I like the approximation because it's COARSE, and I'm reasonably confident that
it's an upper bound (since we're throwing _whole fields_ away, rather than
weathering the crossing and doing something time-resolved, and we're doing so
in the cases when only M dwarfs are affected). Since even as an
upper bound it comes out small, I can post-facto rationalize that we don't need
to be more detailed (if it was a much bigger effect on the yield, that would not 
be the case).

>> Page 22 - I really like that there is justification for conservative modeling.
>> It felt completely arbitrary as we were working on it.

Right (discussed above).

>> Page 22 (second to last bullet point) - Being unable to query TRILEGAL isn't a

Yes - the point of the sentence is that a good scientific reason to avoid the
galactic disk is that we should not rely on planet detections there, since we
will likely not be able to decontaminate them from EB false positives. The
practical reason is that we can't query TRILEGAL there b/c there are too many
stars.

>> Page 23 (third bullet point) - The first sentence is not grammatical and is
>> missing "be" after "can", or change "can" to "are"

Fixed.

>> Page 24 (first bullet point, second dash) - Should "merit" be in the same
>> changed font as previous instances for consistency?

Yes, thanks.

>> Page 25 - Figure 10 caption, second sentence isn't grammatical "detections in
>> are complete" - 

Removed "in" - thanks.

>> Page 29 - First sentence of the last paragraph before 2.3 is not grammatical
>> ("that" should be "which are")

Fixed.

>> Page 30 - Words over Figure 13 are low fidelity and hard to read.

Yeah this was some weird rendering thing. Regenerated and fixed.

>> Page 31 - For number 6. what is the trailing vs for?

Removed.

>> Page 32 - Figure 14 is very hard to read and I can't see any green numbers.

Eep - my oversight. Bolded and regenerated the figure in a way that I think
fixes the resolution.

>> Page 38 - number 6. "collects" should be "collect"

Fixed.

>> Page 48 - first full sentence of the page is not grammatical (missing a comma
>> and a verb?)

Fixed.

>> Page 49 - "Guest Investigator..." has more italicized than it should.

Intentional, but rephrased for consistent styling.

>> Page 52 - Those are rough x and y axis labels. Can those be moved to the
>> caption and replaced with something more succint?

I agree that they're long, but for an appendix figure I think this is better 
than putting some symbol there, and forcing people to read the caption to
learn that the symbol means what is already a kind of complicated thing.
