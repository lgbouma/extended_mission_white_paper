* Sec 1.1: add discussion of OOM issue with a pole-focused mission:
  looking at the ecliptic pole btwn 2&3 puts 4 just 45deg off from the sun.

* Merge into memo (as appendices or in relevant sections):
  * Discussion of whether sun is being adequately blocked in pole scenario
    (likely is not). Likely footnote when pole is introduced.
  * Analytic version of the extra scattered light calcn
  * Moon,Earth,Sun additional flux plots.

* Possible: Table with QUALITATIVE differences btwn scenarios:
  * e.g., allsky 2transit issue and the pole scenario of scattered light.

  --> Plausible qualitative issues: 
    scattered light (Earth/Moon/Sun), 
    bad ephemerides, 
    P>20d dependent on 2 transits, 
    zodiacal background, 
    extensible (to>year3), 
    ability to move targets from FFIs to PSs, 
    overlap w/
      K2, 
      Kepler, 
      JWST, 
      CHEOPS

Contact Isaac:
  * Can we have a read-only (for anonymous people) version of the wiki page?
  (a single URL & its sub-URLs)
  * Make this happen before Monday, Nov 21.
