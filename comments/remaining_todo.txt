* p2 "a lot of these are simply changing Ntra=1 to Ntra=2"
  -> mention the low Ntra statistics result in exec summ? (that allsky is bad
  for getting large number of transits)
* p7 pole suppression: is it actually blocking the sun adequately? really not
  obvious (see OOM calcn sent to Roland).
* p16: we're getting into alternatives, is it too early?
  -> move discussion of alternative prioritization approaches to end?
* p21: (Remark) it would make more sense for us to account for scattered sunlight 
  in the same manner as zodiacal light in S+15. Compute a photon flux which 
  varies as a function of ecliptic latitude & LONGITUDE. Assuming longitude=0 
  (in sun direction), combine with lens hood plot **analytically**
* Sec 1.1: add discussion of OOM issue with an pole-focused mission:
  looking at the ecliptic pole btwn 2&3 puts 4 just 45deg off from the sun.
  This is bad.

* In Exec Summ, Make caveat that allsky is overly dependent on 2 transit
  scenarios.
  (in the paragraph of "to first order, everything is the same".
  then, "however, there are some qualitative differences that are not obvious")

* Possible: Table with QUALITATIVE differences btwn scenarios:
  * e.g., allsky 2transit issue
  and the pole scenario of scattered light.

* Added appendix with OOM calculation (perhaps with equations) describing the
  issue with pole scenario.

  --> Plausible qualitative issues: 
    scattered light (Earth/Moon/Sun), 
    bad ephemerides, 
    P>20d dependent on 2 transits, 
    zodiacal background, 
    extensible (to>year3), 
    ability to move targets from FFIs to PSs, 
    overlap w/
      K2, 
      Kepler, 
      JWST, 
      CHEOPS

Contact Isaac:
  * Can we have a read-only (for anonymous people) version of the wiki page?
  (a single URL & its sub-URLs)
  * Make this happen before Monday, Nov 21.

Memo to attendees by Monday of presentation week. (Dec 5)

To TSC no later than Monday 21st Nov.; then they'll have 2 weeks.






other:

* Kipping & Lam 2016 seemed to have missed this question of the probability of 
  detecting an outer companion as a function of the orbital inclination of the 
  inner companion.
  Likely be worth emailing them about.
