\noindent {\bf Executive Summary}\\

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) will perform
a two-year, nearly all-sky survey for transiting exoplanets.  There do
not appear to be any fundamental obstacles to continuing science
operations for at least several years following the Primary Mission.  Any
Extended Mission will likely need to be organized while the Primary
Mission is occupying most of the \tess team's attention. 
The purpose of this white paper is to provide a head start to 
those who are planning and proposing for an Extended Mission.

Many factors other than prospects for planet detection will likely
influence the choice of an Extended Mission. We have created
an accompanying Wiki document\footnote{\url{https://spacebook.mit.edu/display/TESS/Extended+Missions}. Contact \url{luke@astro.princeton.edu}, copying \url{imeister@mit.edu}, for an account with editing rights. The page can be read by anyone.} that can be edited by named members of the community to raise and discuss those broad issues.  

This report is focused narrowly on planet detection. 
Using Monte Carlo simulations, we try to anticipate the quantities and
types of planets that would be detected during several plausible
scenarios for a one-year Extended Mission following the two-year
Primary Mission. Our main focus is on strategies for scanning
the sky. For simplicity we do not compare different choices
either for the cadence of photometric measurements or for the target
stars to be selected, although different choices might prove to be
advantageous and should be studied in future work.

Throughout this report we consider six different scenarios for Year 3
of the \tess mission, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:strategies}:

	\caption{Six proposed pointing strategies for a \tess Extended
          Mission, visualized in ecliptic coordinates.  Note that none
          of these scenarios spend the entire year observing the
          ecliptic; we concluded that such a plan would be inadvisable
          because of interruptions by the Earth and Moon (see
          Fig.~\protect\ref{fig:earth_moon_elong}).}
	\label{fig:strategies}
\end{figure*}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \nhemi, which re-observes one of the ecliptic hemispheres in
  essentially the same manner as in the Primary Mission (i.e.,
  neglecting the zone within $6^\circ$ of the ecliptic);
  
\item \shemiAvoid, which re-observes one of the ecliptic
  hemispheres, but this time covering the entire hemisphere at the
  expense of the continuous-viewing zone near the pole;
  
\item \npole, which focuses on one of the two ecliptic poles;

\item \elong, which has a series of pointings with the long
  axis of the $24^\circ\times96^\circ$ field-of-view along the
  ecliptic (in combination with
  some fields near the ecliptic pole, when the Earth or Moon would
  prevent effective observations of the ecliptic);
  
\item \eshort, which has a series of pointings with the short
  axis of the field-of-view along the ecliptic (again in combination
  with some fields near the ecliptic pole);
  
\item \hemis, which covers nearly the entire sky with 14-day
  pointings (as opposed to the 28-day pointings of the Primary
  Mission), by alternating between northern and southern hemispheres.
 
\end{enumerate}

We numerically compute the results based on the methodology
of~\citet{Sullivan_2015}, after bug fixes and enhancements by Luke Bouma in
consultation with Josh Winn. Additional inputs were provided by Jacobi
Kosiarek and Peter McCullough.

Some of the most important findings are:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The overall quantity of detected planets\footnote{We define `detected 
planet' to mean one with at least two observed transits, and a phase-folded 
$\mathrm{SNR} > 7.3$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:detection_criterion})} does not depend
  strongly on the sky-scanning schedule.  Among the six scenarios
  considered here, the number of newly-detected planets with radii
  less than $4R_\oplus$ is the same to within about 30\%.

\item The number of newly-detected sub-Neptune radius planets ($R_p \lesssim 
4R_\oplus$) in Year 3 is approximately the same as the number detected in 
either Year 1 or
  Year 2.  Thus, we do not expect a sharp fall-off in the planet
  discovery rate in Year 3.  This is because the Primary Mission will
  leave behind many short-period transiting planets with bright host
  stars, with a signal-to-noise ratio just below the threshold for
  detection.  These planets can be detected by collecting more data in
  Year 3.

\item Regarding newly detected sub-Neptunes, the \hemis, \npole, and
  \shemiAvoid\,strategies offer the greatest number (1300-1400, as
  compared to the 1250 during each year of the Primary Mission).
 
\item Regarding planets with orbital periods >20 days, any one of the
  \hemis, \npole, or \nhemi\:strategies would discover twice as many
  such planets as will be discovered in each year of the Primary
  Mission. This would help to overcome one of the main limitations of
  the Primary Mission: the strong bias toward shorter orbital periods.

\item Regarding new planets with very bright host stars ($I_c<10$),
  the \hemis, \shemiAvoid, and \eshort\:strategies offer the greatest
  numbers ($\sim\!$190, about the same as are found in each year of the
  Primary Mission; see Table~\ref{tab:icmag_meta}).

\item Regarding planets with near-terrestrial insolation ($0.2 
  <S/S_\oplus< 2$), all the strategies considered here offer similar
  numbers (about 120, as compared to 105 in each year of the Primary
  Mission).
    
\item Apart from detecting new planets, a potentially important
  function of an Extended Mission would be to improve our ability to
  predict the times of future transits and occultations of 
  {\it TESS}-detected planets.  With data from the Primary Mission 
  alone, the uncertainty in planetary orbital periods will inhibit 
  follow-up observations after only a few years, as the transit ephemerides
  become stale.
