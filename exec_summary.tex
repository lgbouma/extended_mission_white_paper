\section{Executive Summary}

%What should \tess do after completing its primary mission?
\tess is scheduled to launch in December of 2017.
The primary mission will run for two years, and the \tess Science Office will submit a proposal for an extended mission to NASA's senior review of operating missions in early 2020.
In this report we lay out technical requirements, science goals, opportunities, and risks that will impact the decision of how \tess should observe after completing its primary mission.
%We use these metrics to compare
%we evaluate how well select  defined over 1 year of extra observing achieve s. %and (3)
%We also discuss the opportunities and risks that may arise from each pointing strategy.
%This report defines metrics by which to compare extended missions and uses them to compare proposed spacecraft pointings for how well a set of proposed spacecraft pointings defined , for 1 year of extra observing, satisfy different technical requirements and science goals, and (3) discusses the opportunities and risks that may arise from each pointing strategy.

	\label{fig:strategies}
\end{figure*}
Building on \citet{Sullivan_2015}, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the population of planets that \tess will detect for the Year-3 observing strategies shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:strategies}.
None of our proposed strategies entail observing the ecliptic for an entire year.
For $\sim\!4$ months of such a scenario, the Earth and Moon cross \tesss field of view at a drastically higher rate than during the rest of the year (Fig.~\ref{fig:earth_moon_elong}).
We circumvent this issue by proposing \elong\ and \eshort.
We also note in passing that \hemis\ spends a single spacecraft orbit ($\sim$14 days) per field, `zig-zagging' across the sky.


% THE TRIUMPHANT STATEMENT OF RESULTS
The most notable result from this study is that a third year's extended mission will yield as many new sub-Neptune radius planets as either Years 1 or 2 -- roughly $1250$.
This holds irregardless of where on the sky observe, with the newly detected planet yields varying by $\lesssim 30\%$ between our six proposed scenarios.

Another notable result is that it will be possible to detect about as many new $P>20$ day planets in one year of \tesss extended mission as in both years of the primary mission.

\paragraph{Assessing pointing strategies based on yield statistics} 
Different strategies perform better and worse by different metrics.
We focus only on detected planets with $R_p<4R_\oplus$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:yield_results}).
In terms of absolute sub-Neptune radius planet yield, \hemis, \npole, and \shemiAvoid\ offer the most new planets (1300-1400, compared to the primary mission's 2500).
\hemis, \npole, and \nhemi\ offer the most new long period planets (250-300, compared to the primary mission's 290).
\hemis, \shemiAvoid, and \eshort\ offer the most new planets orbiting $I_c<10$ hosts ($\sim$190, compared to the primary's 385; see Table~\ref{tab:icmag_meta}).
%cf bright_star_comparison_Ic_lt_10.ipynb
They all offer similar numbers of new habitable zone planets (about 120, to the primary's 210)\footnote{We let `habitable zone' mean that the planet insolation $S$ is within $0.2S_\oplus-2S_\oplus$. The physically-motivated~\protect\citet{kopparapu_habitable_2013} HZ gives roughly a third of our quoted numbers (Fig.~\protect\ref{fig:scatter_habitable_zone}).}.
\npole\ is the worst at detecting new planets with atmospheres that are amenable for atmospheric follow-up, but extended missions only yield $10-25$ such planets, compared to the primary mission's $\sim$110.\footnote{We let `amenable for atmospheric follow-up' mean $\mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{atm} > \mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{GJ\ 1214b}/4 $, where $\mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{atm}$ refers to the signal-to-noise of the planet in transmission over 4 transits observed by \jwsts NIRISS instrument, and the normalization is $\mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{atm}$ for GJ 1214b. Dividing by a factor of four helps avoid small-number fluctuations. Note for \textit{JWST} follow-up the ecliptic latitude of the detections also matters (see following footnote).}

An important assumption behind these statistics is that we assume 2 transits and a phase-folded SNR of 7.3 are sufficient for detection.
\hemis\ is more dependent on this assumption than any other scenario: it detects the most new planets and the most new $P>20$ day planets, but if we were to modify our detection requirement to $N_\mathrm{tra}\geq 3$, roughly half of the long period planets that \hemis\ detects would be lost (Fig.~\ref{fig:Ntra_hist}).
By way of comparison, \npole\ detects most of its long-period planets with $\ge 4$ transits.
%\npole\ and \elong's detections have the greatest relative fractions of $N_\mathrm{tra} \ge 3$ planets.





\paragraph{Desires in exoplanet science:}
Planet yield statistics are useful, but they are blind to other important considerations.

\textit{1.) Ephemeris times:} 
Our uncertainty on the mid-transit times of \tess objects of interest, $\sigma_{t_c}$, propagate to be roughly
$$\sigma_{t_c}\ \mathrm{[hr]} \approx 2\times\left(\mathrm{number\ of\ years\ after\ detection}\right). $$
This problem is reduced by an order of magnitude if we capture just one transit with a year's baseline after the initial detection (Figs.~\ref{fig:lowering_uncertainty_tc},~\ref{fig:conf_interval_gets_better}).
This argues strongly for an extended mission which, whether over 1 or 2 years, re-observes many of the targets that \tess detects in its primary mission. 
The smallest-radius Earths and super-Earths may otherwise be irrecoverable.

\textit{2.) Follow-up of \tess objects}\newline
\textit{2.1) JWST:} \tess should detect the most promising planets for \jwst follow-up\footnote{We let `promising planets for \jwst follow-up' mean those that have $R_p<4R_\oplus$, $\mathrm{SNR_{atm}} > \mathrm{SNR_{GJ\ 1214b}}/5$, and absolute ecliptic latitude $|\beta|>80^\circ$ so that they can be observed for more than two-thirds of the year by \jwst\!.} after only a year's observation (Table~\ref{tab:jwst2}).
This means that \tess is not `bound' to the ecliptic poles in an extended mission to support \jwsts target selection.
More important for ensuring \jwst\!--\tess overlap will be the efficient spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of \tesss planets from the ground; by \jwsts launch in October 2018, only a few verified \tess planets will be known.

\textit{2.2) CHEOPSs'} visibility is best near the ecliptic, and non-existent near the ecliptic poles.
Extended missions that focus exclusively on the ecliptic poles neglect \tess and \cheopss complementarity~\citep{berta_cheops_2016}.
Those that focus on the ecliptic, including \elong\ and \eshort, provide the largest amount of overlapping coverage, with \nhemi\ providing a middle-ground.
%While these are separate missions with separate driving goals (\cheops aims to)
%measure the bulk density of super-Earths and Neptunes orbiting bright stars and provide suitable targets for future in-depth characterisation studies of exoplanets in these mass and size ranges

\textit{2.3)} % Ground-based spectroscopic and photometric follow-up} are essential steps of learning about \tesss detections.
The primary mission will clarify whether the availability of \textit{ground-based follow-up resources} will need to constrain \tesss extended observing.
Ideally, it will not.
%The \tess team's immediate collaborators, as well as the broader astronomical community, have photometric and spectroscopic instruments over both hemispheres.
%\tess should be able to observe anywhere without risking insufficient follow-up for the planets it discovers.


\textit{3.) \tess as a follow-up mission:}
%In its primary mission, \tess looks at fields that have already been observed from the ground and space.
\tesss target list in the primary mission will include known planet-hosts from transit and RV surveys.
%\tess adds value to these systems in the primary mission, but s
Summarizing those that are most strategically important for an extended mission:
%: for transiting planets discovered from the ground, it could discover additional transiting companions while also refining a planet's physical and orbital parameters.
%A stunning example is the WASP-47 system, for which the WASP team found a hot Jupiter, subsequent RV follow-up yielded a $P=2$ year Jupiter-mass outer companion, and further \ktwo observations yielded two $R_p<4R_\oplus$ planets transiting inside and outside of the hot Jupiter's orbit~\cite{hellier_wasp47_2012,neveu-vanmalle_HJrelatives_2016,becker_wasp47_2015,dai_doppler_2015}).
%Even for the \kepler field, which \tess will observe with less precision than \kepler had, \tesss observations will aid analyses of transit timing variations, secure a small number of long-period transiters, and provide a cross-calibration between the two missions.

\textit{3.1) The Kepler field} receives $\sim$52 days of coverage from \tess in 2019 (Fig.~\ref{fig:positions_pointings}).
An extended mission like \npole\ could observe the field for 104 days per year -- twice as long as say repeating \nhemi.
The main reasons to allocate extra importance to \keplers field include:
%\textit{(a)} detecting transits (\textit{e.g.,} to refine ephemerides);
\textit{(a)} measuring transit timing variations over a long baseline;
\textit{(b)} confirming few-transit KOI candidates, 
\textit{(c)} calibrating \tess against well-studied candidates,
\textit{(d)} continuing observations of circumbinary planets, and
\textit{(e)} characterizing stellar cycles over long timescales. % through star-spot measurements.
\citet{sullivan_KOIs_2013} studied \tesss performance on the field in detail, and found that \tess %even with \tesss reduced sensitivity to \keplers dim stars, it
should detect $\sim\!5\%$ of KOIs at $\geq\!3\sigma$ significance per transit.
A few dozen of these planets have $R_p<4R_\oplus$, and $\sim$50 reside in multi-planet systems and are likely to give valuable TTV measurements.
We note that \citet{sullivan_KOIs_2013} used October 2013's KOI catalog, which now lists $\sim$7000 objects of interest.

\textit{3.2) K2's fields} will have covered $\gtrsim\!60\%$ of the area in the $|\beta|<6^\circ$ band about the ecliptic by the beginning of \tesss extended mission.
Our simulated planet populations for both \elong\ and \eshort\ assumed no knowledge from \ktwo\!.
This is unrealistic.
A large fraction of the planets that \tess will be capable of detecting near the ecliptic will already either exist as candidates in \ktwos data or have been discovered\footnote{Our coarse estimate is that $\sim$175 of \tesss 500 new $|\beta<12^\circ|$, $R_p<4R_\oplus$ detections from \elong\ would already be detected by \ktwo (see Sec.~\protect\ref{sec:risks_opps})}.
%For a scenario like \elong, the average \tess coverage per star over the extended mission in the $\pm12^\circ$ band would be $\sim$7 spacecraft orbits, or $\sim$91 days of near-continuous observing (to \ktwos $\sim$80).	
Summarizing then what we find to be the most compelling reasons to observe the ecliptic in an extended \tess mission:
\textit{(a)} combine \tess and \ktwo data, doubling the \ktwo observing baseline for most targets. In turn, confirm low-SNR candidates, and detect extra transits for a relatively large number of $20<P<40$ day planets;
\textit{(b)} catch `holes' in the $|\beta| < 12^\circ$ band that \ktwo missed, completing the all-sky search for small planets transiting the brightest stars;
\textit{(c)} observe targets in \ktwo fields that simply were not selected in \ktwos $\sim\!2\times10^4$ per campaign. For instance, \tesss bandpass allows probing down to cooler M dwarfs;
\textit{(d)} measure TTVs for targets over baselines up to 5-years.
\textit{(e)} confirm a small but significant number of $P>40$ day planets.

Given the central role that combining \tess and \ktwo data would play if \tess were to observe the ecliptic, and given our non-treatment of this question in our yield simulations, we recommend that a detailed study of \ktwo and \tesss combined potential be carried out before ruling for or against \elong\ or \eshort.

\textit{3.3) \tess following up ground-based surveys:}
%\tesss photometric precision provides the greatest relative benefit for planets that have never been observed from space.
The north and south skies have similar numbers of known ground-detected transiting and RV planets, so the desire to follow up ground-based surveys probably will not impact \tesss extended mission on a 1-year timescale.
Over 2-year timescales, if an extended mission were to focus on a single hemisphere it would neglect half of the known transiting/RV planets, no longer \textit{(a)} discovering additional small transiting companions (\`a la WASP 47) or \textit{(b)} improving uncertainties in the physical and orbital parameters of known planets.


\paragraph{Desires outside of exoplanet science:}
We motivate cases for using \tess data in asteroseismology, variable-star astronomy (pulsating stars, eruptive stars, supernovae), and solar system astronomy (main belt asteroids) in Sec.~\ref{sec:broader_nonexo_science}.
To our understanding an extended mission can observe anywhere on the sky without neglecting these sub-fields.
Observational cadence is a more important free-parameter -- asteroseismology in particular benefits greatly from short cadence data.

%We recommend specifically for the \tess (SPOC...) to solicit experts in the subfield of variable-star astronomy to contribute their knowledge of these targets for \tesss primary mission (perhaps in a working group; at least in Guest Observer proposals).

\paragraph{Results summary:}
\begin{description}
	\item[1 year extension:]
%	If you don't waste months looking at the Earth and Moon, you can look anywhere and find many planets. 
	None of the pointing options that we propose are obviously bad (Fig.~\ref{fig:yield_results}).
	\hemis\ does well under idealized assumptions, but is risky because of aliasing and low $N_\mathrm{tra}$ issues. 
	That said, it would be the fastest way to deal with the ephemeris issue.
	The biggest qualitative difference between looking at and away from the ecliptic is \textit{K2}.
%	I ignored this issue.
	\textit{K2} does mean fewer `new \tess planets', but combining the two datasets might lead to many long period planet detections (see recommendations -- we did not deal with this quantitatively).
	
	\item[2 year extension:]
	Knowing when \tess planets transit is incredibly important for follow-up efforts, and needs to be addressed either through \hemis\ or by going `all-sky' over two years.
	We did not study 2-year extensions in depth, but we know that doing the opposite-hemisphere complements of \nhemi, \npole, and \shemiAvoid\ would yield the same large number of new planets as from Year 3.
	Another reason to observe both hemispheres is to be sure that we have really detected all of the best super-Earths for transmission spectroscopy (Table~\ref{tab:jwst2}).
	
	The main reason to repeat one-hemisphere observations indefinitely is to detect long period planets.
	Our opinion is that the reasons to observe all-sky are more compelling.
	
\end{description}



\paragraph{Recommendations (expanded in Sec.~\ref{sec:recommendations}):}

\begin{description}
	\item[Analyze target prioritization problem] and decide whether or not to optimize target selection based on results. %for instance \'a la~\protect\citet{kipping_transit_2016}. 
	%Planet occurrence rates are functionally dependent on a star's properties -- should this affect which stars we give upgraded cadence?
	%Is our proposed \texttt{Merit} statistic (Eq.~\ref{eq:merit}) how we want to prioritize targets?
	
	\item[Optimize cadence:] 200k at 2min vs. 400k at 4min, \& related trade-offs.
	
	\item[Take steps to address the `upgrading cadence' problem:] 
	if there is a likely transiting planet in full frame image data, upgrading the planet to short cadence in future observing sectors improves the probability and quality of detection.
	
	\item[Guest Investigator Office / \tess Science Office: solicit advice]
	%from experts in asteroseismology and variable-sky astronomy to understand how extended missions affect their science cases (\textit{e.g.}, data throughput rates are particularly important for time-sensitive supernovae observations).
	More broadly, solicit community feedback during the process of defining the extended mission.
	This may entail a call for white papers, comments on this report, or direct proposals to the GI office. 
	%As exemplified in NASA’s 2016 Astrophysics Senior Review, everyone benefits from the discussions generated by such community feedback~\citep{donahue_senior_2016}.
	
	\item[Decide (explicitly or implicitly) on weights between our proposed metrics.]
	Sec.~\ref{sec:comparing_pointing_strategies} gives a summarized list.
	%Are the $\lesssim30\%$ variations in absolute new planet yields more valuable than other desires or opportunities?
	
	\item[Simulate combining \tess and \ktwo data from \rm{\elong\ } \textit{and} \rm{\eshort}.] 
	This is perhaps the most important qualitative difference between observing towards and away from the ecliptic.
	%Would \tess\!+\ktwo enable more discoveries out at long periods than alternatives?
	%How many of the new planets that \tess detects on the ecliptic will actually be detected by \ktwo?
	%Is the value-added of combining datasets a compelling case compared with discovery?
	
	%\item[Further topics for study:]
	%\textit{1.)}
	%Would observing \npole\ for 2 years hit the `low-hanging fruit' barrier?
	%How much dimmer would the host stars of new planets be in such a scenario?
	%Would the planets tend to be smaller?
	%Would there be fewer of them?
	%\textit{2.)}
	%Study the limiting case of \hemis\ for 2 years, vs primary mission repeat for 2 years, vs \npole$\times$2 for 2 years. The most interesting aspect here is the continuous viewing zones: 2 CVZs at 14-day sampling, vs. 2 CVZs at continuous sampling for one-year each, vs. 1 CVZ for full sampling over two years.\footnote{Our simplified perfect period extraction would miss challenges from the data processing.}

\begin{comment}
\textit{Targets beyond cool bright dwarfs:} there are many classes of targets we may wish to observe with \tess, possibly for exoplanet science, and possibly for other astronomy/astrophysics (\textbf{see K2 page for list. Solar system, extragalactic, exoplanets, ...}).

In exoplanets, following up on the \kepler field promises a substantial scientific return, though mainly for science beyond planet discovery (measuring transit timing variations, refining ephemerides, building SNR on few-transit candidates).
There are numerous non-\kepler transiting planets that should be considered: these will be observed during the primary mission, and will have a relatively larger `value-added' than the KOIs in terms of improved photometric precision and detection of smaller companions.
On the ecliptic, observing the \ktwo field would let us do \textit{this, that and the other}, but would mean losing long-term coverage at an ecliptic pole, a noiser field (Earth/Moon crossings, zodicial background, main-belt asteroids).

Other subfields of astronomy would argue it in different ways. 
Asteroseismic targets are wherever we look.
There are no known open clusters near the North Ecliptic Pole, and there are a handful near the South.
Variable stars will be everywhere, but the best-characterized fields are the MACHO and OGLE-III/IV fields near the South Ecliptic Pole.

\paragraph{Risks and opportunities in exoplanet science}


\textbf{Earth and Moon crossings}
This work took a na\"ive approach towards modeling the Earth and Moon crossing through \tesss field of view: informed by detailed calculations of how common these crossings will be, we simply \textit{dropped} a corresponding number of fields from our planet yield calculation.
This lowered the yield of $R_p<4R_\oplus$ planets by $\sim\!10\%$.
Given that Earth/Moon crossings typically last for a small fraction of an orbit (Fig.~\ref{fig:earth_moon_primary}), if the timescales required for the cameras to `re-settle' after the crossings are small compared to orbital timescales, then our approach over-estimates the effect.

\textbf{What's best for two years of extended observing?}
The fact that \tess can detect many small planets orbiting bright stars across the sky strong argues towards continuing observing `all-sky', rather than focusing observations on a single ecliptic hemisphere after the primary mission's completion.

Reasons to do all-sky two years: ephemerides for \tess planets; detect just as many new planets as from Year 3; 
Reasons to do one-hemisphere for eternity: long period planets

that none of our extended mission pointing scenarios produce yields that are that different:
for a single year's extended mission, \textbf{none of the extended missions proposed here are exceptional stand-outs}.
In terms of raw planet detection statistics (what gives the most new planets? at the longest periods? \&c.) \hemis, \npole, 

An important follow-up: \textbf{but they are slightly different}.
